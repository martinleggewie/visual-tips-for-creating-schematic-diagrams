# Some visual tipps to improve system diagrams
An article which describes my personal view on how we can improve the readability of system diagrams.


## Introduction

So, before I write about system diagrams and how I design them to make them easy to read for the consumers, I would like to first define what I mean when I write about system diagrams?

A **system diagram** is a visual communication tool to explain how different IT systems are connected to each other, and which users interact with them.
Typically, the visual language of such diagrams consists stick figures, boxes which maybe contain other boxes, and connecting arrows which - well - connect the stick figures with the boxes, and the various boxes with each other.

Below you see an example of such a system diagram:

![example system diagram - reduced to the max](diagrams/example-systemdiagram_reduced-to-the-max.png)

I don't know about you, but I think that this diagram is already quite readable.
Admittedly, it is also not very complicated because it contains only one user, three systems, one database, and in total six connection arrows.

Now, let me show you another diagram which contains the same information.
But this time the creator (who was me, by the way) applied some other visual style to the various elements.

In my point-of-view this diagram is much more difficult to read.
The reason for this is a suboptimal usage of colors, fonts, shapes, and sizes of things in relation to each other.

Maybe you think that I exaggerate here.
But I don't.
I have already seen quite some real world examples in my business life which were not too far away from the example above.
If you want to see more of such examples please just do an Internet search for the term "system diagram", and check the images your preferred search engine returns.
Some of them will be in a clean style, maybe similar to the first example system diagram shown above.
But also there will be quite some images which are visually closer to the second example diagram.

Please don't misunderstand me:
I do not want to finger-point here on others who have created such diagrams.
Most of us including me are not trained designers who had some education about the use of such visual elements.
Also, the tools which are out there also not always support a clean way.
They offer a wide variety of visual elements with some - in my perception - suboptimal default configuration.

Over the years I have experimented a lot with several tools which can be used to create diagrams, and from that experiments I distilled some general rules I now (try to) apply when I want to create such system diagrams.
Obviously, these rules helped me creating diagrams which I liked because of their clean structure and simplicity.
But so far I only had these rules stored in my head.
With this document I want to change this and get these rules persisted in a written text, accompanied by many visual examples.
I am aware that these rules will most likely not change the world, but maybe you can find some tipps which support you the next time you have to create such diagrams.


## About text

### Choose font size inside boxes to be big enough compared to the size of the box

## First, some hand-drawn images

This section shows all the concept art I have created to prepare writing this article.
Using a hand-drawn approach helped me because a) it actually makes fun to draw something, and b) forces me to use a different skill set than just typing on a computer keyboard.
